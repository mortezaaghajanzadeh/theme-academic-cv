  This paper examines the effects of carbon policies on capital reallocation and emission reductions in the economy,
  using a model that captures the interactions between green and brown capital, productivity, and emissions.
  The model is estimated using data from the Swedish manufacturing sector between 1990 and 2015.

## Abstract
This paper examines the effects of carbon policies on capital reallocation and emission reductions in the economy.
It uses a model that captures the interactions between green and brown capital, productivity, and emissions.

## Key Findings
1. The elasticity of substitution between green and brown capital is lower in high-emission industries.
2. The emission tax accounts for a 54% reduction, and technology improvements add another 50%.
3. Productivity growth raises emissions by 64%, leading to a net 40% reduction overall.
4. To meet a 75% reduction target by 2040, the tax rate must increase by 270% above current levels.

## Policy Implications
The emission tax is the most effective policy instrument. Achieving equivalent reductions through green capital subsidies
would require unrealistic interest rate discounts and would reduce total output significantly.
